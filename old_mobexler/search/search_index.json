Importing the downloaded OVA file Select the default configuration 4.Once the virtual box image has been imported successfully, go to Mobexler v1.0 \u2192 Settings \u2192 Network and confirm that one of the network cards has NAT and other has Host Only Adapter connection. Note: The name of Host Only Adapter can change depending upon the operating system you are using and the name you have given to it.

Go to Applications \u2192 Internet \u2192 Launch Firefox and open any website. Note: Mobexler comes preinstalled with Android Studio. But because of the limitation of running an ARM based emulator inside the virtualbox, the emulator becomes extremely slow (10 times slower). Due to this reason, we strongly suggest setting up the lab using Genymotion as the emulator, or using any real android device as the test device. Setting Up Genymotion As a Test Device/Emulator Steps: Go to the Genymotion Website and download a \u201cGenymotion For Fun\u201d application \u2192 Genymotion For Fun. Installed the downloaded application, register/sign in to free account and launch \u201cGenymotion\u201d from application/program list. Genymotion Application Showing List Of Available Emulators Note: For testing, you are free to download and setup any available genymotion image. In this tutorial, we will use \u201cGoogle Nexus 5X - 7.0 API 24\u201d. Now from the genymotion application, select the device \u201cGoogle Nexus 5X - 7.0 API 24\u201d \u2192 Install Installting Emulator Once the Genymotion device image has been downloaded, run the image to make sure it\u2019s working fine. genymotion Now, go to the website \u200b https://apkpure.com/\u200b and download the APK for \u201cWifi ADB\u201d application. Link: \u200b https://apkpure.com/search?q=wifi+adb * * Once the apk is downloaded, simply drag and drop the apk over the running Genymotion Device. This will install and launch the application, Wifi ADB. 8.Now, go to setting of Android Emulator \u2192 WiFi settings \u2192 Forget Wifi. * * Once the wifi has been disconnected, go to Wifi ADB application and select the button to start Wifi over ADB. If asked for Root Permissions \u2192 Select Allow or Allow Always.
